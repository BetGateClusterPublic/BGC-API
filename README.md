## BGC API anatomy
The BGC API consists of two main components: the Platform API and the Trading Feeds APIs. The Platform API serves as a low-level transportation system over RabbitMQ exchanges, facilitating communication at a fundamental level. On the other hand, the Trading Feeds APIs are responsible for describing the platform's domains and data structures related to trading activities. Together, these components form a comprehensive framework that allows seamless communication and understanding of data structures within the BGC platform.

## REST API Endpoints
Being supplementary for streaming data feed, BGC REST API is a
imed to provide it's customers with data recovery and historical data access.

### Data recovery flows
No matter if it's environment cold start or live data loss, any entity can be re-requested by it's id.

### Historical data access

## Integration flow
### RabbitMQ binding schemas

## Trading feeds
Trading feeds represent technical events and related bettable content in a form of upcoming, live and historical data. 
Each Trading feed is backed by it's own trading and scout tools forming up trader specific domain, market types and data structures. Every single Trading feed API is composed from general domain documentation and repositories defining data structures and transfer objects.

### GT feed
GT feed operates with the following entities:
* sports
* categories
* tournaments
* events
* markets
* markets results
* scores

To see extensive details for GT feed data structures please see the [GT domain](GT-DOMAIN.md) page.

While the GT feed integration flow is straightforward from sport category to tournament event up to market with market results, the most tricky part lays in building the content for users. Every market has a selection key that can be used together with Translations API to get the exact name for the market. For more details see [GT APIs](GT-APIS.md) page.
